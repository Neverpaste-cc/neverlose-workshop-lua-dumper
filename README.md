# neverlose-workshop-lua-dumper
This was supposed to be a private project before someone leaked it...

## Update: We hereby announce that we will not be releasing a 'neverlose' crack, and we strongly advise against placing any faith in the existence of such cracks currently, as they may potentially be Remote Access Trojans (RATs). Therefore, we urge you to exercise caution.

### Revision: We would like to clarify that this repository is not associated with Russia or any Russian entities. We caution our users against placing trust in any individual claiming ownership of this repository and soliciting the sale of illicit items, such as 'neverlose' cracks or dumps. Such individuals may potentially be engaging in fraudulent activity, and we advise exercising discretion and due diligence in all online transactions.

### this lua will not work anymore after neverlose update, and will 100% get you banned, however improvements can be made to this lua to make it undetectable by neverlose driver, right now it uses a trampoline hook which is easy to detect (first 5 bytes), there are smarter ways to approach this :) but we got fucked by tinyc compiler for so long that we lost our patience on trying to fix the trash shellcodes generated from tinyc compiler

## Lua Dumper Usage: 
**WARNING: SINCE THE LUA IS NOW OPEN SOURCE, NEVERLOSE STAFF CAN EASILY CHECK IF YOU HAVE RAN THE LUA OR NOT RESULTING IN THE BAN OF YOUR ACCOUNT**

load the lua that you want to "borrow",

load the dumper lua,

unload the lua that you want to "borrow",

load the lua that you want to "borrow",

unload the lua that you want to "borrow",

unload the dumper lua,

**SHUTDOWN CSGO IMMEDIATELY**,

**ALL OF THE ABOVE HAS TO BE DONE WITHIN 5 SECONDS ELSE THE DUMPER LUA WITH AUTOMATICALLY UNHOOK TO PREVENT YOU FROM GETTING BANNED**

dumped lua is located @ C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Counter-Strike Global Offensive\UwU.lulz

it contains more than just the lua itself, the beginning is the neverlose internal lua which gets loaded along with every loaded script, and then the actual lua that is getting loaded (closed source scripts are compiled to ljbc while open sourced scripts are in plain text), plus the strings that were passed into the lua loadstring() function, so depending on which lua you are trying to "borrow", it may contain more than just one ljbc/lua, you need to separate them and decompile them yourself

## Dll dumper Usage:
**DO NOT LOAD IT ANYMORE, IT **WILL** RESULT IN BAN**

load the lua

find the neverlose located @ C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Counter-Strike Global Offensive\cooldump_0xCAFEBABE.bin

## Why are the dumps named UwU.lulz

## Why has this become public?

because some retarded **CHINAMAN** guinea pig leaked it :) thus we had to make it public.
else this would not have happened until later this month. Sadly.

as you can see, the code base is cluttered and full of random shit just sitting there waiting to be disposed of. We would like to refine the code but those retards didn't give us enough time to make everything perfect. Anyways I hope you guys had fun and happy easter!

## Have you told neverlose staff about this?

Yes we have, and twice actually, but they didn't respond to us in time leading to this release

```
Oh, joyous day! I simply had to share the news with you all: your cheat is undoubtedly the epitome of cybersecurity! Hail to sulferw, the almighty coder who would never stoop so low as to copy and paste! Personally, I can't wait to install a driver that messes with my computer's memory and files. And let's not forget that neverlose workshop is an impenetrable fortress that will shield my precious lua from being leaked, unlike that pathetic Solus UI. Bravo, bravo indeed!

## Are you scared of getting RAT from neverlose?

No, **if** they rat us, we will let all of the neverlose customers know what exactly they did.
